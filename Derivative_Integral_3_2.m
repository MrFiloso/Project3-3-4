%Create a script that will:
% Determine the position function by integrating the function up to each value of time shown.
% Create three separate plots: acceleration, velocity, and position.
% -All graphs should
%show time values from 0 to 12 seconds
%include a grid, title and axes labels (include units on your axes labels

%Create time and velocity arrays
time = 0:1:12;
vel = [0 1 1.8 2.4 2.6 2.7 2.6 2.2 2 1.9 1.8 1.8 1.8];
% Determine the acceleration function by using the central difference estimation of the derivative.
