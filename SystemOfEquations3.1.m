Create a script that will:
• Ask the user for three sets of (x,y) coordinates that a parabola passes through.
• Solve a system of equations to determine the coefficients a, b, and c for the equation for the parabola
𝑦 = 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐
• Display the equation for that parabola on the screen
• Graph the parabola AND the three points that the user entered on the same plot for values of x from -10 to
10.
o Include a title and grid for the plot
